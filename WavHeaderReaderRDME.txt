WavHeaderReader README

/*WavHeaderReader is a simple class to facilate reading data from Wav Files.
This class was initially developed to aid in a small school project. We used
an audio library called PortAudio instead of the native ubuntu audio API. I would
greatly recommend this to anyone interested in playing music from Wav files.

For more information on the Wav file format, this website was incredibly helpful

Happy Coding!
